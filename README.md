# npr-directions
A web application to provide NPR radio stations along a directional driving route.

This web application talks to the [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview) and the [NPR Station API](https://dev.npr.org/api/?urls.primaryName=station) in order to determine NPR stations nearest to a driving direction route. The user provides a starting and ending address, and the application returns a set of NPR stations and their frequency.
